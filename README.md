# cub3d

cub3D

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game.

The goal is to display a first person 3D view of the inside of a maze, and making possible to move and explore it, using raycasting techniques.

See the subject PDF for more details. Some maps for testing are in the "cub" folder. Look in the Makefile for quick testing configuration.

It was mandatory to use the graphic library "minilibx", provided by 42.

It was developped and tested on Linux. Making is work on Mac might require some changes in the code. See the comment part of the Makefile.
