# cub3d

This project is part of the cursus of 42 school. It is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game.

The goal is to display a first person 3D view of the inside of a maze, and making possible to move and explore it, using raycasting techniques.

See the subject PDF for more details. 

It was mandatory to use the graphic library "minilibx", provided by 42.

# Usage

This project currently only works in Linux. Some minor changes are necessary to make it work on Mac, some indications can be found in the Makefile.

Clone this repo and simply type 'make'.

The Makefile will automatically try to install all necessary packages to make the minilibx work. You might have to type in your password.

Then you can launch cub3D by typing ./cub3D [path to a .cub file].

There are some already made .cub files inside the folder 'files/cub'. Feel free to create new ones with your own map design, colors, textures and sprites.
